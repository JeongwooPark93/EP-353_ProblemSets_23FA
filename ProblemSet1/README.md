## Problem Set 1

### Problem 1.4_Question

**1. What is the code doing?**
A. First, it calls the stdio header library through the 12th line.
It relates with input and output function.
And then, the code makes the main function where the code made by user executes.
In this code, the user makes the simple output "Hello, World!" through printf.

**2. What programming elements are used in the code (e.g., comments)?**
A. The code contains several elements written below.
⋅⋅⋅ 1)  Comment: Two comment types are used in the code.
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ a. //: This makes the single-line comment.
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ b. /*~*/: Whatever you write inside, this turns into a comment. 
⋅⋅⋅ 2)  Preprocessor Directive: As I mentioned above, the code includes "stdio.h" file.
⋅⋅⋅ 3)  Function Definition: The code includes main function. This makes the code to excute.
⋅⋅⋅ 4)  Function: The code makes output displaying "Hello, World!" through printf.

**3. What is the result of compiling and running the program?**
A.  When you compile the .c file, you will get the computer-readable binary code file.
    You can run this file for getting the result through code.
    This time, you will get the simple output showing "Hello, World!".

**4. What happens if you change the text inside double quotes (") within the printf function to something else?**
A.  If I change the text inside double quotes to something else like "Change the text", the code will display what I wrote.
