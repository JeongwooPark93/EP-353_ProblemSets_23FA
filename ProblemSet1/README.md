## Problem Set 1

### Problem 1.4_Question

**1. What is the code doing?** <br />
**A.**  First, it calls the stdio header library through the 12th line. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It relates with input and output function. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, the code makes the main function where the code made by user executes. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this code, the user makes the simple output "Hello, World!" through printf. <br />

**2. What programming elements are used in the code (e.g., comments)?** <br />
**A.**  The code contains several elements written below. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Comment: Two comment types are used in the code. <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. //: This makes the single-line comment. <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. /*~*/: Whatever you write inside, this turns into a comment.  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Preprocessor Directive: As I mentioned above, the code includes "_stdio.h_" file. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Function Definition: The code includes main function. This makes the code to excute. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Function: The code makes output displaying "Hello, World!" through printf.

**3. What is the result of compiling and running the program?** <br />
**A.**  When you compile the .c file, you will get the computer-readable binary code file. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can run this file for getting the result through code. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, you will get the simple output showing "Hello, World!".

**4. What happens if you change the text inside double quotes (") within the printf function to something else?** <br />
**A.**  If I change the text inside double quotes to something else like "Change the text", the code will display what I wrote.
