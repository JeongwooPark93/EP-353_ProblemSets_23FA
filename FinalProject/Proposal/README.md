# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

> Visual Synth

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a wavetable synthesizer.")

> My project is about creating an analog synthesizer showing live graphic parameter.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

> My software will be a virtual instrument, literally analog synthesizer. It will have some oscillators, compressors, ADSR, and etc that user can control with their own tastes. Moreover, a graphic parameter will show what sound user makes. It will looks like frequency analyzer.

## In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And it is not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

> I would like to take this opportunity to try creating a Graphic Analyzer above all else. As a student currently studying sound, a visualized analyzer would be immensely helpful in both my work and studies. Moreover, I believe that if I can create a versatile analyzer, it would serve as a foundation for developing various plugins in the future.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

> If I manage to complete these tasks before the deadline, I plan to create tabs within this plugin to attempt the development of other useful features. For instance, functionalities like saving presets and metadata for user-created sounds, or implementing a patchbay to allow users to make their sounds more diverse and enjoyable, seem like interesting possibilities.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

> I will list below in order of what I will make:
 - Oscillators
 - Key controllers
 - Graphic Analyzer
 - Compressor / Envelope Generator
 - Reverb / Delay

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

> First, I have to study how to make visualized plugin with Juce. And then, I should learn how to build Graphic Analyzer while making Oscillators and Key controllers.
